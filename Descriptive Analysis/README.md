This folder contains stuff related to descriptive analysis.

Descriptive analysis is done on f_{category} and f_{category}_weight from "year_lsoa_grocery.csv".

The three pie charts in this folder visualizes the distribution of food and drinks purchases, food purchases and food purchases by weight, respectively.

When drawing the pie charts, some smaller categories are combined to make them more comparable to other bigger categories:
f_dairy_eggs = f_dairy + f_eggs
f_fish_meat = f_fish + f_meat_red + f_poultry
f_alcoholic_drinks = f_beer + f_spirits + f_wine
f_non_alcoholic_drinks = f_soft_drinks + f_tea_coffee + f_water
f_oils_sauces = f_fats_oils + f_sauces

The seven histograms in this folder visualizes the statistical distribution of the fractions of dairy and eggs, fish and meat, fruit and vegetable, grains, oils and sauces, readymade and sweets, by weight, respectively.

The box plot in this folder compares the statistical distribution of these fractions on the same plot.

# Grocery-Big-Data-Analysis-and-Clustering
The is part of the coursework for 5011CEM Big Data Programming Project. 

This project used data collected and pre-processed by Aiello, L.M., Schifanella, R., Quercia, D., & Del Prete, L. (2020). The source of dataset is from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4769354.v2. The research paper related to the dataset can be found at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0397-7. 

This project has 2 parts, namely descriptive analysis and clustering. 

The descriptive analysis part is arranged under the "Descriptive Analysis" folder. In the descriptive analysis part, the grocery purchase data is analysed based on its distribution (mean, median, first quartile, third quartile, minimum value and maximum value) and histograms and boxplots are drawn. Besides that, the grocery purchase data is used to draw a pie chart to illustrate the percentage of sales of each food and drinks category. 

The clustering part is arranged under the "Clustering" folder. In the clustering part, all customers are split into 4 clusters. While I was considering the number of clusters, I tried out different number of clusters and compared the sum of squares error within cluster and the Silhouette width. The members of each cluster are analysed and the distinct behaviour of each cluster (in terms of fraction of buying certain type of food) is visualized using boxplots.
